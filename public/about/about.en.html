<h2>How to Play FreeCell</h2>

<p>Welcome to FreeCell! It's a fun and easy-to-learn solitaire card game that's perfect for kids. Your mission is to move all 52 cards into four foundation piles—one for each suit—starting with the Ace and ending with the King. Follow these simple steps to master FreeCell:</p>

<h2>1. Set Up the Table</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Deal eight piles of face-up cards (the tableau).</li>
  <li>You'll see four empty "free cells" in the top left.</li>
  <li>Four empty foundation slots sit in the top right.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Your Available Moves</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Move any tableau's top card into a free cell to save it for later.</li>
  <li>Stack one card onto another tableau pile only if it's one rank lower and the opposite color (for example, place a red 5 on a black 6).</li>
  <li>Whenever the next card in a suit is free (for example, the 2 of Hearts after you've revealed the Ace of Hearts), send it straight to its foundation spot.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Smart Use of Free Cells</h2>

<p>Those four free cells are your secret helpers! Use them to hold cards when you need to shuffle piles around—but don't fill them all up at once.</p>

<h2>4. Building Your Foundations</h2>

<p>Start by moving each Ace into an empty foundation. Then add cards in order—2, 3, 4, and so on—until you reach the King.</p>

<h2>5. Winning the Game</h2>

<p>When all 52 cards are neatly stacked from Ace through King in their matching foundations, you've won!</p>

<p>FreeCell is all about clever planning and clear thinking. Keep an eye on colors and ranks, use your free cells wisely, and have fun clearing the deck!</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks for Freecell</h2>

<p>Hey, little card champions! Want to become a Freecell master and have fun right in your web browser? Try these clever yet simple ideas—no extra downloads, just instant play!</p>

<h2>1. Turn Empty Columns into Your Secret Passages</h2>
<p>Whenever you clear an entire column, treat it like a hidden hallway. Slide cards through that open spot to shift whole stacks around. It’s like unlocking a shortcut in a maze!</p>

<h2>2. Rescue Your Low Cards First</h2>
<p>Aces and twos are your superheroes in disguise. Free them early by moving them straight to the foundation piles. That gives you more breathing room for bigger stacks later on.</p>

<h2>3. Stash Cards in Your “Treasure Boxes”</h2>
<p>Think of each free cell as a little chest where you can hide one card temporarily. Tuck away tricky cards there to break up long sequences—just remember to empty your treasure boxes before filling up the board!</p>

<h2>4. Become a Two-Move Thinker</h2>
<p>Before you click, ask yourself, “What if I move that queen now—will it block another card afterward?” Planning two moves ahead will help you avoid getting stuck and keep your game flowing.</p>

<h2>5. Bounce Back Anytime You Like</h2>
<p>Playing online means your game waits for you. Close the tab, grab a snack, then pop right back to where you left off. Your next big win is always just one click away!</p>
